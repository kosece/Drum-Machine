# Drum Machine
 A drum machine with multiple sound effects that you can play by pressing keys on your keyboard.

# Known issues
You can only play a sound effect again once it has finished playing, not allowing you to "overlap" them and play high tempo beats.
The animation that plays when you press a key will still show up even if the sound effect isn't playing because of the issue mentioned above.
